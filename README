README

This is the embryonic beginning of nd - a debugger/simulator,in the style of
Borland Turbo Debugger, for the Data General Nova minicomputer.

It is very much a work in progress. There is still a lot of work to be done,
not in the least being the simulation of more I/O devices and giving it a better
user interface using the ncurses library.

Why am I doing this?

Firstly, my C skills are pretty rudimentary so writing this is a way of
improving them. With problems, one encounters solutions and learns something
from them in the process.

Secondly, I have a pair of Nova 3 minicomputers and an Eclipse S/130 in
Australia which I couldn't take with me to Scotland. Surprised? Yes, I miss
them and being able to toggle trivial little program into the front panel
switches.

My initial aim is to provide an emulation of the basic hardware and some
necessary I/O. To be able to boot an operating system isn't high up on my list
at the moment. For something like that, go to

	http://simh.trailing-edge.com
	
and download simh. No really, do it!!!

That is not to discount the possibility of booting an OS in the future. Anything
can happen really. 'Tis a wide world I've opened the doors to, and with
increasing ability anything is possible. ;-)
