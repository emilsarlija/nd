Here are some small programs that you can assemble and run on the simulator.
I've been using them to make sure certain features were working properly and
have included them here for your fun and enjoyment.

For a really cool Nova cross assembler, go to:

	http://www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/info/dpa.html
	
This is what I've been using to assemble these programs with. To try it
yourself, I've included a "Hello World" program called hello.sr amongst others.
After compiling and installing the assembler, assemble hello.sr by typing:

	dga -l -b hello.sr
	
This will create two new files caled hello.sr.lst and hello.sr.boot
which are the listing and bootstrap binary respectively. Load hello.sr.boot into
nd by typing:

	nd hello.sr.boot
	
after which you'll be prompted to either run, single step, and examine or
disassemble memory.

Whahooo!!!

One thing I learn't is a lot can be tested with "Hello World" programs.

FILES:

hello.sr -	A "Hello World" program.

helsub.sr -	Another "Hello World" program but this one uses the stack for
		the subroutine.
		
helinc.sr -	Yet another "Hello World" program but this one uses an auto 
		incrementing memory location.
		
heldec.sr -	As above, but this time auto decrementing. This one was a
		nightmare in creating the message due to the way the bytes are
		packed. 
		
trifl.sr -	Courtesy of Carl R. Friend. A timing loop. Takes 30 seconds to
		run on a real Nova 3.
